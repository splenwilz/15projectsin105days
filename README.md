# 15projectsin105days
This is a complete web development walkthrough, where we'll be building 15 projects from scratch up to deployment stage. We'll utilize basic technologies like HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, build up with libraries and frameworks to include bootstrap, jquery, reactjs, etc.

## 1. Football Livescore
- We'll create the UI shown below during the first week of working on the project using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
- This will help us learn the fundamental CSS ideas of basic styling and the CSS grid system.
- When we return to this project, we'll discuss responsiveness and how we'll use media queries to scale the web app for all screen sizes
- The next step will be interactive animations, where Javascript will be used extensively.
- Since we need live results of daily matches played We'll be populating our result via an API at `https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-football`
